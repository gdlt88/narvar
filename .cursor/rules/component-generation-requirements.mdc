# Component Generation Requirements

## Process
1. **Preferred**
 - Ask user to provide the component name, purpose and requirements.
 - Determine the appropriate component type (presentational, container, form, etc.).
 - Collected component information must be displayed and asked for confirmation.
2. **Default to Simple** - Start with minimal implementation
3. DO NOT add extra features unless asked

## General Rules
Create components at the components directory: `**/components/[component-name]/index.jsx`

## Guidelines
**IMPORTANT** 
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Use kebab-case for directories
- Start simple, expand only if requested
- One main purpose per component
